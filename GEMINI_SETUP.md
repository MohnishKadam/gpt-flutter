# Gemini API Integration Setup

Your project has been successfully integrated with Google's Gemini AI API! Here's what you need to know:

## 🚀 What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `http: ^1.1.0` - For making HTTP requests to Gemini API
- `convert: ^3.1.1` - For base64 encoding (image support)

### 2. New Files Created
- `lib/models/message.dart` - Message model for Gemini API compatibility
- `lib/models/ai_model.dart` - AI model enum with different Gemini models
- `lib/services/gemini_service.dart` - Complete Gemini API service implementation

### 3. Updated Files
- `lib/controllers/chat_controller.dart` - Now uses Gemini service instead of mock responses
- `lib/services/chat_services.dart` - Updated to use real Gemini API calls
- `lib/main.dart` - Added ChatController initialization
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added new dependencies

## 🔑 API Key Setup

**IMPORTANT:** You need to set up your Gemini API key to make the integration work.

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended for Production)
```bash
flutter run --dart-define="GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here"
```

### Option 2: Temporary Hardcoded Key (Development Only)
A temporary API key is already included for testing, but you should replace it with your own:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Replace the hardcoded key in `lib/services/gemini_service.dart` line 14

**⚠️ Security Warning:** Never commit hardcoded API keys to version control!

## 🤖 Available Models

Your app now supports these Gemini models:
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (default) - Fast and versatile
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** - Fast and efficient for most tasks
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro Vision** - Can analyze images and text
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** - Newest and most advanced model

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ What's Working
- Real-time AI responses using Gemini API
- Rate limiting (1.1 seconds between requests)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Support for text conversations
- Image upload capability (ready for vision models)
- Streaming responses (real-time text generation)

### 🎨 UI Unchanged
Your existing UI remains exactly the same! All chat screens, widgets, and user interactions work as before.

## 🛠️ Usage

The integration is seamless - your app will now:

1. **Send user messages** to Gemini API instead of returning mock responses
2. **Display real AI responses** from Google's Gemini models
3. **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly error messages
4. **Respect rate limits** to stay within API quotas

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing the Default Model
In `lib/controllers/chat_controller.dart`, line 9:
```dart
final selectedModel = AIModel.gemini15Flash.obs; // Change this
```

### Adjusting Temperature and Max Tokens
In `lib/services/gemini_service.dart`, modify the `chatCompletion` method parameters:
```dart
temperature: 0.7,  // Creativity (0.0 to 1.0)
maxTokens: 1000,   // Response length limit
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "API key is not configured" Error
- Make sure you've set the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
- Or update the hardcoded key in the service file

### Rate Limit Errors
- The service automatically handles rate limiting
- If you still get errors, consider upgrading your Gemini API quota

### Network Errors
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API key is valid and has the correct permissions

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Test the integration** - Try sending messages and verify you get real AI responses
2. **Set up your own API key** - Replace the temporary key with your own
3. **Customize the experience** - Adjust models, temperature, and other parameters as needed
4. **Deploy with confidence** - Your UI is unchanged, so existing users won't notice any difference!

Happy coding! 🎉
